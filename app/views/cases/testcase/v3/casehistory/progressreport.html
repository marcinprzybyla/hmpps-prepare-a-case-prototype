      <p class="govuk-body">Mr Armstrong has completed 23 hours and has 17 hours left on his current community order
        with unpaid work, RAR days and a court accredited programme. He has a good work reports from his supervisors but
        his attendance has recently been sporadic due to bereavements and illness. He provided evidence for absences
        when asked.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">He has attended 6 sessions of his accredited programme (Building Better Relationships). He
        is making good
        progress and engaging well with the course.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Mr Armstrong is suitable for a concurrent order and would benefit from a further 12 month
        community order with
        RAR days focusing on victim awareness and problem solving. I would propose up to 15 additional RAR days. He is
        also suitable for further unpaid work should the court wish to add this as further punishment.</p>
